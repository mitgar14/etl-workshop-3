    "# ***World Happiness Report - Model Training and Metrics***\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this notebook, we will carry out the training of a Machine Learning model using the World Happiness Report dataset. This process will include several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before training the model, it is crucial to preprocess the data. This may include normalizing or standardizing features, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset Splitting**: We will split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to fit the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Selection and Training**: We will choose an appropriate Machine Learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.) and train the model using the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**: We will evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, recall, F1-score, etc.) and the testing dataset. This will allow us to understand how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: If necessary, we will perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. This may include techniques such as grid search or random search.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Results Interpretation**: Finally, we will interpret the obtained results and discuss the implications of the trained model. This may include identifying the most important features and understanding how the model makes decisions."
